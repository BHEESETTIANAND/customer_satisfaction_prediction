# Airplane Service Customer Satisfaction Prediction ✈️😊📊
Welcome to the Airplane Service Customer Satisfaction Prediction project! This repository focuses on predicting customer satisfaction with the services provided on airplanes. The dataset has been preprocessed, features engineered, and models built to provide insights into customer experiences and satisfaction levels.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset contains information related to airplane services, including customer feedback, service ratings, flight details, and other relevant features. It has been cleaned and processed to ensure suitability for predictive modeling.

## Feature Engineering 🔧
Several features have been engineered to capture meaningful information from the raw dataset. This process involves transforming existing features and creating new ones to improve the predictive power of the models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈
EDA has been performed to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries have been utilized to understand the distribution of features and identify potential correlations.

## Model Building 🛠️
Multiple machine learning models have been constructed to predict customer satisfaction with airplane services. Various algorithms, including Decision Trees, random forest have been implemented and evaluated.

## ML Ops Integration 🚀
This project integrates ML Ops tools to streamline model development and deployment processes.

### MLflow 📊
MLflow has been utilized for continuous tracking of model performance and metrics. Experiment tracking and model versioning have been managed using MLflow's capabilities. Charts generated by MLflow have facilitated the identification of the best-performing model and its associated hyperparameters.

### Prefect ⚙️
Prefect, another ML Ops tool, has been incorporated for continued model training. Prefect enables automated workflows for scheduling and orchestrating model training processes, ensuring that models are regularly updated with new data.

## Streamlit Application 🌐
An interactive Streamlit application has been developed to provide users with a user-friendly interface for making predictions using the trained models.

To use the Streamlit application:

### Note: Additionally, I have included a video showcasing the integration of MLflow and Prefect in another project, specifically a sentiment analysis application. This serves as a parallel example to demonstrate how similar integration methodologies have been applied in the current project.
